# RESTful-api-livecode-session-v1
A basic RESTful api created as a practise for a live coding session to show students how to create their own RESTful api.  

Fork the repository and clone it - have fun and experiment with it! Don't forget to create a .env file and add your Mongo credentials to it.

## Endpoints
Endpoints.json file will be added over the weekend for you to easily see the routes accessible to you. In the mean time, have a look around the app and see if you can work out what the enpoints are. Feel free to add your own and experiment!
